###Approach/How it works
User is presented with a landing page, giving them an understanding of the use of the web application. User has the ability to sign in via Twitter with the twitter sign in page, or via the login button in the navigaton bar. Once signed in user twitter image will appear next to the home button on navigation bar. 

Navigation bar shows:

* Home button 
* Place button 
* Login (for Twitter) button
* Logout (for twitter) button
* User image from twitter
* RAD London Logo
